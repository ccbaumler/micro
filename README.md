Welcome to the Micro 101

# Introduction

Welcome and bienvenue

# Project Structure

After following [the link to our JupyterLite session](https://ccbaumler.github.io/micro/), you should see:

1. A `data` directory containing all the data for the notebooks to use.
    - In each subpoint describe each data file
3. A `notebooks` directory containing all the Jupyter notebooks for this class.
    - In each subpoint briefly describe each notebook. It is also best practice to number them in their filename.
5. A `README.md`
    - This is the document you are reading now!
